# Sudan Humanitarian Analysis (2023–2025)

## 📊 Project Focus

- Analyze displacement patterns and food insecurity using statistical models
- Visualize regional disparities in humanitarian need
- Explore the relationship between displacement, funding, and food access
- Highlight data-driven insights through storytelling and spatial analysis
